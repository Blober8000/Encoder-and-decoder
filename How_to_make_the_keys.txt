if you don't know what I mean by a key it basicaly is a version of the alphabet all messed up to encode your message.
there are 2 mais ways I use to create keys being the 1st one the safest yet most "dangerous" one because if you accidentaly repeat a letter or don't put all of them it'll break the code. The second one being the faster (to create) yet the least safe because it's easier to crack this one.

1st one is by smashing the keyboard completly random and making sure all leters are on that list and they don't repeat themselvesor you'll have a bad time when decoding.
example: alksnzpmerfxdcvtyuqwiojhgb I wouldn't recommend using this one because someonme can use it to crack your coded messages


the 2nd one is by pasting 2 alphabets together and then chosing a letter to start of
tutorial

step 1: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz


step 2: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
			  ^

step 3: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
			  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

step 4: stuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqr
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

step 5: stuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqr Congrats you have your key now!

both methods can be used to create number keys and letter keys.
